# Rust Game Boy Emulator

A Game Boy emulator written in Rust for learning purposes.

## About

This project is being developed to study and learn about:
- Rust programming language
- Emulator development
- Game Boy hardware architecture

I'm following the excellent guide at [https://aquova.net/emudev/gb/index.html](https://aquova.net/emudev/gb/index.html) to understand the Game Boy's internals and implement the emulator.

## Status

🚧 Work in progress
